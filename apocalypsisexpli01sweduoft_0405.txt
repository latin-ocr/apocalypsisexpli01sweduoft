CAP. 111„ VERS. 20.—N. 25o[c]. 399

Cenae, leguntur, quae hic adducentur in vernacula in qua
sunt scriptae.

[bo] “ The way and means to be received as worthy partakers o
that Holy T able, is, first to examine your lives and conversations
the rule of God's commandments: and wherein soever ye shall per-
cetve yourselves to have offended, either by will, word, or deed, there
to bewail your own sinsulness, and to confess yourselves to Alnghty
God, with full purpose os amendment of life. And tf ye shall per-
ceive your offences to be such as are not only against God, but also
against your nezghbors, then ye shall reconcile yourselves unto them,
being ready to make restitution and satisfac'tzon according to the
uttermost of your power, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to
any other ,· and being likewise ready to forgive others that have
qffended you, as ye would have forgiveness of your ffences at God's
hand: for otherwise the receiving of the Holy Communion doth nothing
eLse but increase your damnation. Theresore if any of you be a blas-
phemer of God, a hinderer or slanderer of His Word, an adulterer,
or be in malice or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent you
of your sins, or else come not. to that Holy Table,· lest aster the tak-

tion both of body and soul. ........

“Judge therefore yourselves, that ye be not judged of the Lord:
repent ye trulyfor your sins past ,· have a lively and steadfast saith in
Christ our Saviour,· amend your lives, and be in persei? charity with
all men. ........

“ Y e that do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins, and are in
love and charity with your neighbors, and intend to live a new lzsefol-
lowing the commandments of God, and walking from henceforth in
His holy ways ,· draw near with saith, and take this Holy Sacrament
to your comfort, and make your humble confession to Alnghty God.’'

[6.] Ex his nunc videri potest quod doctores et antis-
tites ecclesiae sciant, et non sciant, quod haec via sit via ad
caelum, et non via fidei absque illa: sciunt cum illa quae al-
lata sunt coram populo orant et praedicant, sed non‘ sciunt
cum ex doc'trina sua docent. Illam viam vocant Religionem·
practicam, hanc autem Religionem Christianam; sed hanc
credunt esse pro sapientibus, illam autem pro simpiicibus.
Verum asseverare possum quod qui vivunt secundum doc-v
trinam de sola fide et de justificatione per illam, prorsus
nullam fidem spiritualem habeant, et quod post vitam in
mundo in damnationem veniant; at qui vivunt secundum
doctrinam ex orationibus illis allatam, quod fidem spiritu-
alem habeant, et quod post vitam in mundo in caelum ve-
niant; quod etiarn prorsus consentit cum Fide in universo
